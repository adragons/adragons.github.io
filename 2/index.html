        <p>
            but he failed. Here is why.
        </p>

        <p>
            He begins:
            <blockquote>
                ... they show several plots including this one, which is supposed to show
                some evidence of election fraud happening in the 2020 US election
                in the state of Michigan.
                ...
                The idea is this plot should be straight, instead you've got this down
                slope. And that is meant represent a net shift of votes that should have
                been for Donald Trump over to Biden. However if you plot exactly the same
                date from the same precinct from the same county for Biden (which I did,)
                you'd expect to see those votes showing up, there should be an anomaly 
                going the other way. You do that plot: it looks exactly the same.
                This cannot represent a net movement of votes because both plots are the same.
            </blockquote>

            There is probably some misunderstanding here. The plots appear the same
            but <strong>**they do show an anomaly going the other way**</strong>.
            The plots could still represent an algorithmic shift of votes. 
            The graphs **do not show** net votes, they show deviation. Seeing a 
            linear deviation indicates an algorithmic bias towards Biden.
        </p>

        <p>
            In math/statistics speak:
            For a precinct, use the straight party vote as the mean (&#x3bc;) political affiliation, and also the expected value.
            
            By subtracting the mean from presidential vote, we get an equivalent of the 
            standard deviation for that precinct. (&sigma; = X - &#x3bc;) (By omitting the square and square root the direction is kept.)
        </p>
        <p>
            In people speak:
            The x-axis is a precincts affiliation to a party and the y-axis is
            how much more/less it voted relatively for the respective candidate.<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Left on the plot means LESS Democrat or Republican.</li>
                <li>Right on the plot means More Democrat or Republican.</li>
                <li>Up means a precinct vote MORE for a candidate than the precincts political affiliation.</li>
                <li>Down means a precinct vote LESS for a candidate than the precincts political affiliation.</li>
            </ul>
            This means that
            <ul>
                <li>For the Democrat plot, a data point near the x-axis represents a precinct
            that voted for Biden in roughly the same proportion as it's Democrat-ness.</li>
                <li>And likewise for the Republican plot, a data point near the x-axis represents
            a precinct that voted for Trump in roughly the same proportion as it's Republican-ness.</li>
            </ul>
