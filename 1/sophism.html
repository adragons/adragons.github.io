        <p>tl; dr: When god tells humans to do bad things is when religion is bad. 
            Note that this is not the only way
            in which the Quran is immoral, but it is the most severe. Islam is morally bad
            in ways that are unique to Islam.
        </p>

            <dl>
                <dt><h1>sophism</h1></dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>a deceptive or fallacious argumentation. ex:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Islam is just another Abrahamic religion. It teaches many
                        of the same things. They all have their good parts and their 
                        bad parts. Therefore they have roughly equal morality.
                    </blockquote>
                </dd>

        <p>This argument is used frequently. It has
            widely propagated due to ignorance. Ignorance is not meant as an insult here,
            rather it's meant literally, that is, most people do not know a lot about
            the contents of either the Bible or the Quran (or the Torah).
            And it is good that people do not condemn something they know nothing
            about. However these assumptions are gravely wrong.
            The Islamic ideology is morally wrong, it is not compatible with
            democracy.
        </p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, it is true that morality is up for debate.
            For example some people think eating any meat at all is wrong.
            So to give structure to the argument, I will be arguing from the perspective of
            classic Liberal ideals. A rule that assaults individual or human
            rights is immoral. A rule that thwarts democracy or denies its secularism
            is immoral. A rule that condemns a person or people for who they are rather
            than their actions is immoral.
            </p>

        <h3>Islam is uniquely bad</h3>

        <p>The Quran is a book, and books don't <em><strong>do</strong></em> anything.
            So how is ideology it espouses morally wrong? It is necessary to clarify
            and distinguish the different types on messages that can be found in books.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Someone in a book can give meaningless prose or rhetoric, prayers etc.</p>
                <blockquote>Guide us to the straight path</blockquote>
                <blockquote>When the moon hits your eye<br />
                like a big pizza pie<br />
                that's amore.</blockquote>
                <p>There can also be philosophical questions/rhetoric.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil
                    nature through great effort?
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    If you could kill baby Hitler, would you?
                </blockquote>
                <p>These are not immoral.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A person in a book can tell the reader to do something. People 
                have free will and reasoning and are expected to exercise
                these. If Bob the bridge engineer tells you to jump off a bridge,
                that does not mean bridge engineers are bad it means Bob is bad. 
                (Sorry Bob.) Therefore this does not reflect poorly on the ideology.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A person in a book can do something. If someones actions are
                bad, then that someone acted bad. Is <em>the book</em> about a 
                murderer bad, or is only <em>the murderer</em> bad? Only the murderer is bad.
                Therefore someones bad actions do not reflect poorly on an ideology.</p>
                </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a book God can do something. God is omniscient (all-knowing.)
                An all-knowing being does know the ultimate balance of their actions.
                Because we lack this ultimate knowledge, we cannot judge Gods actions.
                For example:
                <br />
                Suppose you have the option to kill someone who <b>will</b> commit
                an evil act. Is your act of murder better in the end than the evil
                thing they were going to do? Or do two wrongs not make a right?
                Or maybe murder is the most evil thing? Does it balance out? Us
                humans can't know, but God can. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a book God can tell the reader to do something. Each religion
                is based on the commands of their God. This is the core of Abrahamic
                religions. God wants you to do (or not) certain things in order to secure
                your position in heaven. <strong>Therefore if God commands the reader to
                do bad this reflects poorly on the ideology.</strong></p>
                <p>A command can be overt or direct: "Do this, don't do that." but it can also
                    be implicit. Since the goal of these religion is heaven, implications
                    that could gain or lose favour turn into implicit commands.
                    If God implies 
                    <blockquote>God loves he who puts ketchup on macaroni.<br />
                    Cursed is he who puts syrup on scrambled eggs.</blockquote>
                    The effect is the same as if God had said directly:
                    "Put ketchup on macaroni. Don't put syrup on eggs."</p>

                            degrees. And to both Allah has promised the best [reward].

            This does not mean all Muslims are bad. Don't go attacking anyone.
            Most people never read their religion's book. It is necessary however
            to acknowledge reality in order to move on to solutions.
